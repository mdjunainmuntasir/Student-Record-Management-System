# Student-Record-Management-System

we will be creating a student record management system using File I/O
operations on objects. We will be using sequential and random file access operations.
1- Create a Student class that contains the following members: ID, Name, Program, Email, Phone
Number, Attendance and CGPA.
2- Create getter functions for all data members. Create setter functions for Program, Email, Phone
Number, Attendance and CGPA.
3- The data of student objects can be saved in a file by those users who have an existing account.
Please use the following Menu to check if the user already has an account. If the user does not have
an account, allow the user to create an account and then allow the user to login using that
information. The data of all users can be saved in a file and can be used for matching username and
password information. A sample output is shown below for creating an account for new user and
for logging in as an existing user.
